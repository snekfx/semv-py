# CODEX Review Results - 2025-09-25

## Regressions & Defects
- [REG-DET-01] (2 SP) Align `get_highest_version` with SEMV contract by returning `"v0.0.0"` when the input list is empty or only contains invalid semver strings; update call sites/tests accordingly.
- [REG-DET-02] (2 SP) Restore repository context schema by adding the missing `root` entry and ensuring `detect_repository_type` reports `"directory"` for non-git workspaces so CLI/tests can rely on a stable shape.
- [REG-DET-03] (5 SP) Extend project detection to walk nested directories (with sensible depth/ignore rules) so multi-project repos surface all manifests (Rust, JS, Python, Bash) instead of only root-level hits.

## Architecture & Concept
- [ARCH-DET-01] (5 SP) Split `detector.py` into focused modules (foundations, manifests, heuristics, reporting) to shrink per-file size, enable partial imports, and support the 70% LOC reduction goal.
- [ARCH-CORE-01] (3 SP) Finalize `SemanticVersion` as an immutable dataclass + `total_ordering`, with parsing/formatting helpers separated from CLI concerns to encourage composition over inheritance.
- [ARCH-CORE-02] (5 SP) Introduce a `VersionManager` service that composes detection, version math, and git backends through dependency injection to prepare for Boxy/GitSim adapters and keep responsibilities slim.

## Performance
- [PERF-DET-01] (3 SP) Cache manifest file reads and parsed metadata during detection runs to avoid redundant `Path.read_text` calls when validating versions across multiple passes.
- [PERF-DET-02] (2 SP) Prototype concurrent detection (thread pool or asyncio + to_thread) for independent language scanners once recursion lands, guarded by feature flag to validate 10x target without over-complicating flow.

## Quality of Life / UX
- [QOL-CLI-01] (1 SP) Replace the runtime `sys.path` mutation in `semvx.cli.main` with a proper console script entry point so packaging and imports work without side effects.
- [QOL-DET-01] (2 SP) Replace placeholder metadata in `repository_info`/`meta` (branch, timestamps) with live values and fallbacks so status output reflects reality and Boxy/GitSim integrations can trust the data.

## Testing & Validation
- [TEST-DET-01] (3 SP) Add coverage for empty-version handling, nested-project discovery, and repository metadata contracts to lock the above fixes and lift the 4 current failing tests.

 🏗️ META-PROCESS v2.1: How to Create Self-Hydrating Workflow Systems
====

🎯 **Purpose**: Transform any messy project into a self-hydrating workflow system
📅 **Created**: 2025-09-20 (based on Boxy project transformation)
🔄 **Result**: 5-minute agent onboarding with zero context reconstruction

====
 📋 OVERVIEW: The Process Process
====

This meta-process shows how to take any chaotic project and create a bulletproof
self-hydrating workflow system that enables:
- ✅ 5-minute productive agent starts
- ✅ Zero manual context reconstruction
- ✅ Consistent handoffs between sessions
- ✅ Automatic documentation validation
- ✅ Multi-speed onboarding (5min/30sec/health-check)

**Based on**: Boxy project transformation (290 story points, 75 tasks, 4+ months work)
**Proven**: Multiple workflow reviews, agent testing, validation automation



====
 🔧 SETUP CHECKLIST
====

 For safety, before beginning this process, you should 
 - make sure you are on the main branch. If you are not then DO NOT RUN THIS PROCESS.
 - make sure there are no pending changes, all files are tracked and committed or stashed as needed. 
 - cut a new branch admin/meta-process for these changes
 - have a copy of `validate-docs.sh`  
   - if you dont you can grep for a copy in other project repos and then use one as a starter template
 - use the `tree --gitignore` command or `tree -d` command to see the current project structure
 - note any documents (md,txt,log, etc) these can vary
 - try to generate a list of all the documents and their path in the repo documents.log for verification
 - if you have acess to #china, ask her to determine the type/content of the docs in document.log


====
 🎯 PHASE 1: PROJECT ASSESSMENT & DISCOVERY
====

## 📊 **Step 1.1: Document Inventory**

**Collect all existing documentation:**
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.rst" | grep -v node_modules | sort
```

**Categories to identify:**
- 📋 **Process docs**: READMEs, workflow guides, setup instructions
- 🔧 **Technical docs**: Architecture, API specs, implementation guides
- 📈 **Planning docs**: Roadmaps, tasks, backlogs, sprints
- 🧠 **Knowledge docs**: Lessons learned, decision records, troubleshooting
- 📊 **Status docs**: Progress tracking, completed work, current state

## 📈 **Step 1.2: Agent/Analysis Inventory**

**If using AI agents for analysis (like China/Tina):**
- Collect all analysis outputs (.eggs/, reports/, analysis/)
- Identify key insights from consolidated wisdom
- Extract actionable technical debt from agent findings
- Note MVP vs nice-to-have triaging results

**Manual alternative:**
- Review commit history for architectural decisions
- Identify recurring issues and patterns
- List technical debt and known problems
- Survey team for pain points and blockers

## 🎯 **Step 1.3: Current State Analysis**

**Identify project characteristics:**
- Project size (lines of code, story points, complexity)
- Team size and handoff frequency
- Documentation quality and organization
- Common context-switching pain points
- Agent/developer onboarding time (current baseline)

====
 🏗️ PHASE 2: STRUCTURE DESIGN & ORGANIZATION
====

## 📁 **Step 2.1: Create Core Directory Structure**

```
project-root/
├── START.txt                    ← Single entry point (ONLY process doc in root)
├── LICENSE                      ← License file (MUST stay at root - industry standard)
├── README.md                    ← Project description (keep at root)
├── docs/
│   ├── *                        ← Other docs and folders may not be updated yet
│   ├── lics/                    ← Licenses (do not move this)
│   ├── misc/                    ← for docs that dont have an obvious home
│   │   └──archive/              ← safe archive for docs that may be old or unprocessed
│   ├── procs/                   ← Process & status documents
│   │   ├── PROCESS.md           ← Master workflow guide
│   │   ├── CONTINUE.md          ← Session status & handoffs
│   │   ├── QUICK_REF.md         ← 30-second context (ultra-fast)
│   │   ├── SPRINT.md            ← Current iteration/sprint tasks
│   │   ├── ROADMAP.md           ← Strategic overview & milestones
│   │   ├── TASKS.md             ← Detailed task breakdown
│   │   └── DONE.md              ← Completed work archive
│   └── ref/                     ← Reference documentation (can be broken down into child folders)
│       ├── [DOMAIN]_GUIDE.md    ← Topic-specific guides
│       ├── ARCHITECTURE.md      ← System architecture
│       ├── LESSONS.md           ← Development lessons learned
│       └── [FEATURE]_SPEC.txt   ← Feature specifications
├── .analysis/                   ← Analysis results (if using AI agents)
│   ├── consolidated_wisdom.txt  ← Key insights summary
│   ├── technical_debt.txt       ← Debt analysis & tickets
│   └── mvp_triage.txt          ← Priority analysis
└── bin/
    └── validate-docs.sh         ← Documentation validation script

NOTE: LICENSE and README.md stay at root - do not move to docs/
```

## 🎯 **Step 2.2: Document Migration Strategy**

**Existing documentation categorization:**
1. **Keep in place**: Code-adjacent docs (API docs, inline documentation), LICENSE, README.md
2. **Move to docs/ref/**: Technical references, architecture, feature specs
3. **Transform to process docs**: READMEs → PROCESS.md, TODO lists → TASKS.md
4. **Archive**: Outdated docs → DONE.md or separate archive
5. **Analysis storage**: Create .analysis/ or .eggs/ for AI agent outputs (optional)

**Migration principles:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for each type of information
- ✅ Clear separation: process vs reference vs analysis
- ✅ Maintain all historical context (don't delete, archive)
- ✅ Update all internal references during migration
- ✅ **NEVER move LICENSE or README.md** - industry standard requires root placement

====
 🎯 PHASE 3: CORE DOCUMENT CREATION
====

## 📄 **Step 3.1: Create START.txt (Entry Point)**

```txt
====
 🚀 [PROJECT NAME] - START HERE
====

👋 **Welcome to [Project] Development!**

📋 **Single Entry Point**: Read docs/procs/PROCESS.md for complete workflow

🎯 **Quick Start** (5 minutes to productive work):
1. Read docs/procs/PROCESS.md ← Master workflow guide (3 min read)
2. Read docs/procs/CONTINUE.md ← Current session status (1 min read)
3. Read docs/procs/SPRINT.md ← Active tasks (1 min read)
4. Begin work with full context

⚡ **Ultra-Fast Start** (30 seconds):
→ Read docs/procs/QUICK_REF.md for essential context only

🔍 **System Health Check**:
→ Run ./bin/validate-docs.sh to verify documentation integrity

📁 **All Process Documents Located in docs/procs/**
🔄 **Self-Hydrating System**: No manual context reconstruction needed!
====
```

## 📋 **Step 3.2: Create PROCESS.md (Master Workflow)**

**Template structure:**
```txt
# PROJECT STRUCTURE & KEY DOCUMENTS
- List all document locations and purposes
- Reference docs/ref/ for topic-specific guidance

# SELF-HYDRATING WORKFLOW PROCESS
- Step 1: Context hydration checklist
- Step 2: Phase detection (Sprint/Planning/Development/etc.)
- Step 3: Work execution patterns for each phase
- Step 4: Session closure & handoff requirements

# PROJECT STATUS QUICK REFERENCE
- Current priorities and focus areas
- Progress tracking metrics
- Decision points and context

# COMMON WORKFLOWS
- Sprint planning, development sessions, milestone transitions
- Include specific commands and tools used

# AGENT QUICK START GUIDE
- Essential context for new team members/agents
- Key project background and architecture
- Workflow rules and conventions

# REFERENCE LINKS
- All essential files by priority
- Topic-specific references in docs/ref/
- Testing & validation tools
```

## ⚡ **Step 3.3: Create QUICK_REF.md (Ultra-Fast Context)**

**30-second context template:**
```txt
🎯 **Current Focus**: [Primary current objective]

📊 **Project Status**:
- ✅ [Completed major phases]
- 🔴 [Active phase with story points]
- ⬆️ [Next major phase]

🚨 **Critical Context**:
- **Blockers**: [Key dependencies/blockers]
- **MVP**: [Scope decisions and priorities]
- **Current Sprint**: [Active tasks summary]

📋 **Current Tasks** (see docs/procs/SPRINT.md):
1. [Task 1 with brief description]
2. [Task 2 with brief description]
3. [Task 3 with brief description]

🏗️ **Architecture**:
- **Branch**: [current branch]
- **Key Commands**: [test, build, deploy commands]

⚡ **Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Read docs/procs/CONTINUE.md for latest status
2. Check docs/procs/SPRINT.md for task details
3. [Project-specific next actions]

🚨 **Critical Rules**:
- [Key development patterns/rules]
- [Testing requirements]
- [Session closure requirements]
```

====
 🎯 PHASE 4: AGENT ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATION (If Applicable)
====

## 🧠 **Step 4.1: Wisdom Consolidation**

**If using AI agents (China/Tina pattern):**

1. **Deploy China (Summary Agent)** for architectural wisdom:
   ```
   Review all project documentation and code. Create a golden summary
   of key architectural insights, development patterns, technical
   challenges solved, and important design decisions. Focus on
   timeless wisdom vs ephemeral status updates. This includes
   any old .session/ directory contents.
   ```

2. **Deploy Tina (Testing Agent)** for quality analysis:
   ```
   Analyze testing infrastructure, code quality, technical debt,
   and compliance gaps. Identify specific actionable improvements
   and create prioritized tickets for technical debt resolution.
   ```

3. **Deploy Triage Agent** for MVP analysis:
   ```
   Review all planned work and separate MVP-critical tasks from
   nice-to-have features. Focus on unblocking dependencies and
   core functionality needed for project success.
   ```
4. **Derived Tasks**
   ```
   Note any potential valid but undocumented tasks/milestones hidden away
   in documents. You can add such tasks to the ROADMAP or BACKLOG or as tasks
   DER-NN (derived). Make sure China and Tina are aware of this in case
   you use them 


## 📋 **Step 4.2: Technical Debt Extraction**

**From agent analysis, extract:**
- **High Priority**: Blockers and critical technical debt
- **Medium Priority**: Quality improvements and optimization
- **Low Priority**: Polish and convenience features

**Create ticket format:**
```
[CATEGORY-NN] Task Title (Story Points) - Priority
- Specific description of what needs to be done
- Why it's important (technical debt reason)
- Acceptance criteria for completion
```

## 🎯 **Step 4.3: MVP Triage Integration**

**Integrate triage results into planning:**
- Update ROADMAP.md with MVP vs full scope
- Adjust TASKS.md priorities based on triage
- Create focused SPRINT.md with critical path items
- Document scope decisions in reference docs

====
 🔧 PHASE 5: AUTOMATION & VALIDATION
====

## 🔍 **Step 5.1: Create Documentation Validator**

**Essential validation script** (bin/validate-docs.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Silent success, noisy failure validation
# Check file existence, reference integrity, staleness warnings
# Only output problems - hide successful validations
```

**Validation features:**
- ✅ File structure integrity (all required docs exist)
- ✅ Internal reference validation (no broken links)
- ✅ Staleness detection (critical docs >1 week, others >1 month)
- ✅ Clean output (only show problems)

## 📝 **Step 5.2: Session Handoff Requirements**

**Mandatory CONTINUE.md updates every session using standardized format:**
```markdown
# Continue Log – [branch-name] + [phase-description]

## HANDOFF-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[HHMM]
### Session Duration: [X hours]
### Branch: [branch-name]
### Completed:
- [Specific completed items with file references]
### Blocked:
- [Blockers with context]
### Next Agent MUST:
- [Critical actions required immediately]
### Context Hash: [git commit SHA]
### Files Modified: [count]

## Configuration Notes
[Project-specific context that agents need immediately]

## [Project] Status
[Key status indicators for the project]
```

## 🎯 **Step 5.3: Multi-Speed Onboarding System**

**Implement three onboarding speeds:**
1. **Complete** (5 minutes): Full workflow documentation
2. **Quick** (30 seconds): QUICK_REF.md essential context
3. **Health Check**: Validation script for system integrity

====
 ✅ PHASE 6: TESTING & REFINEMENT
====

## 🧪 **Step 6.1: Agent Testing Protocol**

**Test the system with fresh agents:**
```
New session prompt: "Please start by reading START.txt and following
the process to get full context, then summarize what you understand
about the current project state."
```

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Agent finds START.txt without guidance
- ✅ Agent follows workflow: PROCESS.md → CONTINUE.md → SPRINT.md
- ✅ Agent demonstrates understanding of current context
- ✅ Agent ready for productive work within 5 minutes
- ✅ No questions about basic project setup or current status

## 📊 **Step 6.2: Validation & Iteration**

**Run validation checks:**
```bash
./bin/validate-docs.sh  # Should show clean output
```

**Test all workflow paths:**
- New agent onboarding (complete & quick)
- Session handoffs (CONTINUE.md updates)
- Sprint transitions (SPRINT.md → new iteration)
- Milestone completion (archive to DONE.md)

## 🔧 **Step 6.3: System Maintenance**

**Regular maintenance tasks:**
- Update CONTINUE.md every session (mandatory)
- Refresh QUICK_REF.md when project focus shifts
- Archive completed work to DONE.md at milestone completion
- Validate documentation integrity before major changes
- Update META_PROCESS.md with lessons learned
